# DASVA
This is nextflow pipeline for Diploid Assembly and Structural Variation calling with Annotation (DASVA).
***`DASVA`*** is an an end-to-end nextflow pipeline for de novo (diploid) assembly of long-read sequencing data, starting with raw sequencing reads, or BAM files (either unaligned or aligned) to generate a haploid assembly using [Flye](https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye), through to converting the haploid assembly into a diploid assembly using [Hapdup](https://github.com/KolmogorovLab/hapdup), and calling (and genotyping) structural variations on the resulting diploid assemblies using [Hapdiff](https://github.com/KolmogorovLab/hapdiff). Structural variants are then annotated using [AnnotSV](https://github.com/lgmgeo/AnnotSV). This pipeline is inspired by my work on rare diseases, and the fact that long-read sequencing has the potential to generate high quality assemblies that can be used to identify rare structural variants that are normally missed by alignment-based variant calling. The assemblies can also be used to build [pangenome graphs](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2025.1679660/full).
